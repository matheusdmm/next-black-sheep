## Introduction

Hybrid Next.js + Python app with Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend. I also included some basic post, get, put, delete and patch funcionality to the API as well as a sqlite connection. For the front, I included axios as the prefered api "getcher".

I also modifier the API entrypoint to have the uvicorn sugar and help a bit more in the dev procces, because now you're able to kill the server if needed and also change the default port.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, log_level="info")
```

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/*`.

There, we'll have the `/api/users/` and the `/api/posts/` which, you guessed it right, will have a dummy userland and posts üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Demo

https://nextjs-fastapi-starter.vercel.app/

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigitros%2Fnextjs-fastapi%2Ftree%2Fmain)

## Developing Locally

You can clone this repo and then do an:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, for run both back and front concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Or, to run the instances separately:

```bash
# for the backend
npm run fastapi-dev

# you can also start the backend manually with
cd ./api
python index.py

# for the frontend
npm run next-dev

```

If You did not changed the ports, You'll be able to run on the defaults as stated below.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)¬†‚Äì feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
